# MCMC Overview

## Definition:
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution by constructing a Markov Chain

## Intuition:
MCMCs "wander around" a lumpy surface (e.g. a probability density function), spending time in an area proportional to its height, and thus infers the target PDF without needing to know the exact height


## Purpose:
